Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism\\nIntroduction\\nDiabetes mellitus and its complications (diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome) are the\\nmost common disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, but alcoholic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia are\\nalso important.\\nDiabetes Mellitus\\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin\\nresistance leading to hyperglycemia. Early symptoms are related to hyperglycemia and include\\npolydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria. Later complications include vascular disease, peripheral\\nneuropathy, and predisposition to infection. Diagnosis is by measuring plasma glucose.\\nTreatment is diet, exercise, and drugs that reduce glucose levels, including insulin and oral\\nantihyperglycemic drugs. Prognosis varies with degree of glucose control.\\nThere are 2 main categories of DM—type 1 and type 2, which can be distinguished by a combination of\\nfeatures (see\\nTable 99-1). Terms that describe the age of onset (juvenile or adult) or type of treatment (insulin- or non-\\ninsulin-dependent) are no longer accurate because of overlap in age groups and treatments between\\ndisease types.\\nImpaired glucose regulation (impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose—see\\nTable 99-2) is an intermediate, possibly transitional, state between normal glucose metabolism and DM\\nthat becomes common with age. It is a significant risk factor for DM and may be present for many years\\nbefore onset of DM. It is associated with an increased\\n[Table 99-1. General Characteristics of Types 1 and 2 Diabetes Mellitus]\\n[Table 99-2. Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes Mellitus and Impaired Glucose Regulation]\\nrisk of cardiovascular disease, but typical diabetic microvascular complications generally do not develop.\\nEtiology\\nType 1: In Type 1 DM (previously called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent), insulin production is absent\\nbecause of autoimmune pancreatic β-cell destruction possibly triggered by an environmental exposure in\\ngenetically susceptible people. Destruction progresses subclinically over months or years until β-cell\\nmass decreases to the point that insulin concentrations are no longer adequate to control plasma glucose', metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20120615054440Z', 'creator': 'Atop CHM to PDF Converter', 'file_path': 'medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': 'D:20250425193936Z', 'page': 1010, 'producer': 'pdf-lib (https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)', 'source': 'medical_diagnosis_manual.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition', 'total_pages': 4114, 'trapped': ''}),\n",

The good news is that there are several effective treatments for high blood pressure. Here are some of the most common ones:\\n\\n1. Lifestyle changes: Making lifestyle changes is often the first line of defense against high blood pressure. This may include eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins; getting regular physical activity; reducing sodium intake; limiting alcohol consumption; quitting smoking; and managing stress through relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing exercises.\\n2. Medications: If lifestyle changes aren't enough to control your blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medications.

    "     The answer is highly relevant to the question as it provides an accurate description of the common symptoms for appendicitis and clarifies that appendicitis cannot be cured via medicine alone but requires surgical removal. The answer also explains the standard treatment for appendicitis, which is open or laparoscopic appendectomy, and mentions the use of antibiotics before surgery to help prevent infection. Therefore, I would give this answer a score of 5.\n",
